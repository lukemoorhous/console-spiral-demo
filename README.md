# genetic-chain-mini-challenge
This repo possesses the code requested by Genetic Chain for their Mini-Challenge, a spiral drawing console program

Further detail can be found in the specification document [here](MINI-CHALLENGE.md)

## Running the mini-challenge program

To start the program, launch the program file from the repo's root directory as follows:

```
$ py program.py
```

The program will then ask you for a size. You can enter any integer here.


Should you wish to change the style of the spiral, you can dive into program.py and alter the spiral class instatiation
